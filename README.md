# HueControlWithUnity
 Control your Philips Hue with a Unity App

 Work In progress

 I am building a library to facilitate Philips Hue integration in your own application.

 For now you can
 * locate your bridge in a local network
 * create a user
 * control lights (On, Off, Fade in)
 * set light colors

 A sample scene is provided to use the different functions

 Warning : locate will freeze your ui as currently the code has a thread sleep. I plan on changing that as soon as possible.

 Next functionalities will be :
 * Color control with a color wheel
 * get the list of your current lights
